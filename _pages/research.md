* **_Racial Steering by Real Estate Intermediaries_** (jointly with Davi Moura and Guilherme Jardim)
  <details>
  <summary>Show abstract</summary>
  Racial steering by real estate agents—showing minority buyers fewer properties in predominantly White neighbourhoods—has been documented since the 1930s and persists today, yet its welfare implications remain understudied with real transaction data. We develop a structural model of intermediated housing search to test whether buyer brokers reduce search costs by aligning buyer-seller preferences, rather than engaging in discriminatory practices.

* **_The Social Value of Rural Electrification: Evidence from Zambia
_** (jointly with Niclas Moneke and Torsten Figueiredo Walter)
  <details>
  <summary>Show abstract</summary>
  Rural electrification suffers from high costs and low private adoption, but its social returns through public infrastructure remain understudied. We analyse the effects of electrifying schools and health facilities across 742 villages in rural Zambia, exploiting staggered grid roll-out and a government mandate to connect public infrastructure. Electrified schools attract more teachers who are younger, more female, and better qualified. Electrified health facilities gain refrigeration, deliver more vaccinations and live births.
