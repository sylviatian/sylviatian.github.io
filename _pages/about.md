I'm Sylvia, a second-year MRes/PhD student studying Economics at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/research-students/Likun-Tian). 


Research Interests
------
 
 - **Network theory**: I am particularly curious about information diffusion in social networks and its impact on belief formation. 
 
  - **Development**: I am interested development economics projects with spatial analysis, potentially intersecting with urban economics. 

 - **Industrial organization**
 


Before PhD
------

I obtained a [MSc degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2024/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics) with distinction from LSE in 2021, and before that I worked as a senior economic consultant at [Edgeworth Economics](https://www.edgewortheconomics.com).
