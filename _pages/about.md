I'm Sylvia, a third-year MRes/PhD student studying Economics at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/research-students/Likun-Tian). 


Research Interests
------
 
 - **Industrial organisation**: I study how institutional entry decisions shape local market outcomes, with a focus on the role of build-to-rent housing developments as coordination devices for neighbourhood change in London.

  - **Development**: I am interested in spatial approaches to development economics. Current work examines the social value of rural electrification in Zambia. 

 - **Network theory**: I am particularly curious about information diffusion in social networks and its impact on belief formation. 
 


Before PhD
------

I obtained a [MSc degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/graduate/msc-econometrics-and-mathematical-economics) with distinction from LSE in 2021, and before that I worked as a senior economic consultant at [Edgeworth Economics](https://www.edgewortheconomics.com).
